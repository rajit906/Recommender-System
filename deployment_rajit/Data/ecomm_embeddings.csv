4,4,5,"Alpine wind jkt - On high ridges, steep ice and anything alpine, this jacket serves as a true ""best of all worlds"" staple. It excels as a stand-alone shell for blustery rock climbs, cool-weather trail runs and high-output ski tours. And then, when conditions have you ice and alpine climbing, it functions as a lightly insulated windshirt on the approach, as well as a frictionless midlayer when it's time to bundle up and tie-in. The polyester ripstop shell with a Deluge DWR (durable water repellent) treatment sheds snow and blocks wind, while the smooth, lightly brushed hanging mesh liner wicks moisture, dries fast, and doesn't bind to your baselayers. Superlight stretch-woven underarm panels enhance breathability and allow for unimpaired arm motion, and the two hand pockets close with zippers. A drawcord hem, elastic cuffs, a heat-transfer reflective logo and a regular-coil, center-front zipper with DWR finish round out the features. Updated this season for an improved fit.

We combined our best knowledge of fabrics, design and technology to create a full-featured, highly technical piece of angling equipment. Waterproof/breathable 3-layer stretch nylon, along with a two-inch longer cut, make this the shell of choice for skiff, bay boat and jet sled guides. Although the design ethic is minimalist, ergonomically placed pockets and custom-engineered ""fish pulls"" (which vastly improve waterproof reverse-coil zipper function) put everything you need at your fingertips. In other words, you can retire your vest. The tuck-away hood won't flap in the wind, and the brushed-fleece lined collar provides decadent comfort. More fishing-specific details: glued-in waterproof zippers, drain holes in hem and pockets, attachment patch, forceps/glasses loop, modified reversed StretchCoat cuffs, rod holder.

Deft adjustment points, die-cut/hand-skived foam and an open-mesh back keep the profile slim (and cool and comfortable to wear, even in a high-backed kayak seat or float tube).

The top is made from lightweight, breathable 100% polyester jersey (now more durable) that wicks moisture, provides 30-UPF sun protection, and dries quickly. The stand-up mini-mock neck has an improved zipper and is now taller for additional sun protection, but still opens deep for high-output ventilation. We've removed the pocket for a more pared-down top, and the new raglan sleeves and side panels reduce seam chafing from your hydration pack straps. Reflective heat-transfer logo keeps you visible.

307,307,308,"Alpine wind jkt - On high ridges, steep ice and anything alpine, this jacket serves as a true ""best of all worlds"" staple. It excels as a stand-alone shell for blustery rock climbs, cool-weather trail runs and high-output ski tours. And then, when conditions have you ice and alpine climbing, it functions as a lightly insulated windshirt on the approach, as well as a frictionless midlayer when it's time to bundle up and tie-in. The polyester ripstop shell with a Deluge DWR (durable water repellent) treatment sheds snow and blocks wind, while the smooth, lightly brushed hanging mesh liner wicks moisture, dries fast, and doesn't bind to your baselayers. Superlight stretch-woven underarm panels enhance breathability and allow for unimpaired arm motion, and the two hand pockets close with zippers. A drawcord hem, elastic cuffs, a heat-transfer reflective logo and a regular-coil, center-front zipper with DWR finish round out the features. Updated this season for an improved fit.

454,454,455,"Guidewater waders - king - We built our Guidewater Waders to be the toughest, most puncture-resistant waterproof/breathable wader on the planet. Of course, we couldn't just stop there. Nope. They also had to be extremely lightweight while offering a groundbreaking level of comfort and convenience. In other words, the ultimate wader. We started by strategically placing varying weights of our proprietary waterproof/breathable polyester microfiber fabric package with H2No Hydrostorm barrier according to specific breathablility or toughness needs. The result? Max durability and flexibility without resorting to excessive heavy, sweat-trapping multiple layers. Our revolutionary merino wool grid-lined neoprene booties increase warmth to double that of normal nylon faced neoprene as it wicks perspiration creating guilt-inducing levels of foot comfort. The most advanced version of our innovative internal suspension system allows easy conversion to waist height and - this is critical - quick relief without having to remove your jacket or fight sticky zippers.

467,467,468,"Guidewater waders - reg - We built our Guidewater Waders to be the toughest, most puncture-resistant waterproof/breathable wader on the planet. Of course, we couldn't just stop there. Nope. They also had to be extremely lightweight while offering a groundbreaking level of comfort and convenience. In other words, the ultimate wader. We started by strategically placing varying weights of our proprietary waterproof/breathable polyester microfiber fabric package with H2No Hydrostorm barrier according to specific breathablility or toughness needs. The result? Max durability and flexibility without resorting to excessive heavy, sweat-trapping multiple layers. Our revolutionary merino wool grid-lined neoprene booties wick perspiration and create guilt-inducing levels of foot comfort. The most advanced version of our innovative internal suspension system allows easy conversion to waist height and - this is critical - quick relief without having to remove your jacket or fight sticky zippers.
